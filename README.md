# Project Templates

This repository contains some simple templates for different
(programming) projects. Being highly opinionated, they may not be
suitable for everyone, for example I reoutinely include local git hooks
for verifying the conventional commit specification. rejecting all
commit messages that don't follow that.

### Notes
Each template project may contain a separate README file, detailing the
individual quirks of each template.
